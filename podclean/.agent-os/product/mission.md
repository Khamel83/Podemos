# Podemos Project Mission

The Podemos project, built upon the `podclean` scaffold, aims to be a specialized pre-processor for podcast content. Its core mission is to provide cleaned (ad-removed) audio and high-quality, structured transcripts, seamlessly integrating with the "Atlas" project.

By centralizing podcast ingestion, ad-cutting, and transcription within Podemos, we aim to:
- **Offload complex podcast processing** from Atlas, allowing Atlas to focus on its core functionalities.
- **Ensure consistent and high-quality cleaned audio** for an improved listening experience.
- **Provide accurate and structured transcripts** for further analysis and use within Atlas.
- **Streamline the data flow** between podcast sources and the Atlas ecosystem, avoiding duplication of effort and potential integration headaches.

Ultimately, Podemos will serve as a robust and efficient pipeline, delivering ready-to-use podcast content to Atlas, thereby enhancing Atlas's capabilities in content analysis and management.
